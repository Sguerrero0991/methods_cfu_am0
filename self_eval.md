# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud of learning more about methods. These examples and exercises 
deepened my level of understanding about the function of methods and 
how to use them in a very basic way. And it was anopther opportunity to 
practice problem solving skills. I feel it will help pave the way for more complex
usage and understanding of methods. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Using methods allows progammers to write code in a block that performs a specific task, allowing you to reuse that code multiple times throughout your coding. It helps improve code readability and maintenance and overall keeps things organized.
